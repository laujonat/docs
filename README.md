## Command Line Interface \(CLI\) vs Graphical User Interface \(GUI\)

Concept and environment configuration guides that are covered will be focused on the CLI. 

* For users unfamiliar with the command line, it is worthwhile to spend ample time becoming familiar with system and user level commands.  
* Despite the steep learning curve, being able to automate tasks with scripts and full permission control of your system can drastically developer productivity. 

| **Basis of comparison between GUI vs CLI** |                          **GUI** |                          **CLI** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Basic | This user interface enables the user to interact with electronic devices with the help of graphical icons and visual indicators. | This user interface enables a user to give a command  to interact with an electronic  device |
| Ease of understating | The graphical user interface is visually intuitive. It is easy to understand for beginners | Due to the need to remembering commands, it is difficult to handle and requires expertise. |
| Memory Requirement | It requires more memory as it consists of a lot of graphical components. | It requires less memory as compared to GUI. |
| Speed | It generally uses a mouse to execute commands. The speed of GUI is Slower than CLI. | Because the keyboard is used to execute the commands, the speed of the CLI is Faster than GUI |
| Appearance | One can change the appearance with a customizable option. |  It is not possible to change the appearance |
| Flexibility | More flexible than CLI | Less flexible than GUI |
| Device used | Keyboard and mouse | Keyboard |
| Precision | Low as compared to the CLI | High as compared to the GUI |
