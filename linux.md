# Linux

## Hello World ðŸ‘‹

Named after its creator, [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), Linux is an operating system made available to the world for free. 

In contrast to proprietary software, Linux is a free and open-sourced OS, anyone is freely licensed to use, copy, study, and change the software in any way.  The code behind open-source software are publicly shared and often encourage developers  to voluntarily improve the design of the software.
