# System Overview

## Hello World ðŸ‘‹

Linux is an operating system made available to the world for free. 

It is named after its creator, [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds).  

In contrast to proprietary software, Linux is a free and open-sourced OS, anyone is freely licensed to use, copy, study, and change the software in any way.  The code behind open-source software are publicly shared and often encourage developers  to voluntarily improve the design of the software.  

## Filesystem Hierarchy Standard \(FHS\) <a id="firstHeading"></a>

Windows, Mac, and UNIX are three of the most widely used operating systems today. Each of these operating systems contain their own set of standards and guidelines of programs running on their platform. 

In Linux, this standard enables:

* Software to predict the location of installed files and directories, and
* Users to predict the location of installed files and directories.

### Init System 

#### `systemd`

* The `systemd` software suite provides fundamental building blocks for a Linux operating system. 
* Upon system start up, `systemd`bootstraps the user space and manages user processes .
* `systemd` aims to unify service configuration and behavior across [Linux distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution)
