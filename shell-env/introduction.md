# Introduction

## Executables

Unix-like operating systems provides the `/bin`directory which contains programs you may call directly from the command line.  These are called _executables_ because they are ready to be run when the system starts. 

* `/bin`
  * Standard subdirectory of the root directory in Unix-like operating systems that contains the executable \(i.e., ready to run\) programs that must be available in order to attain minimal functionality for the purposes of booting \(i.e., starting\) and repairing a system 
* `/usr/bin`
  * Standard directory on [Unix-like](http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html) [operating systems](http://www.linfo.org/operating_systems_list.html) that contains most of the [_executable files_](http://www.linfo.org/executable.html) \(i.e., ready-to-run [programs](http://www.linfo.org/program.html)\) that are not needed for booting \(i.e., starting\) or repairing the system
