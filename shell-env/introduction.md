# Overview

## Why Shell Scripting?

Shell scripting is an extensive topic that will not be covered entirely in this documentation. I still recommend you do explore various shell environments to find one that best suits your development needs. 

In simple terms, scripts run in the shell and read by the shell's interpreter. Maximize your developer efficiency by modifying or creating custom commands that suit your project needs. 

Here are some things you can do with Shell environments:  

* Modify global and user profiles
* Set environment variables when you log in or spawn a new shell
* Create bash functions for frequently used sequences of commands
* Maintain skeleton directories for new user accounts
* Set your command search path

## Streams

Streams are created by entering characters from a keyboard. Different Linux [commands](https://searchwindowsserver.techtarget.com/definition/command), such as sed, allow users to manipulate the stream text, in this case editing the stream.

#### Input Stream

The input stream is a program to interact with your system by typing commands \(the _input stream_\) on the command line. 

#### Output Stream

The output stream displays command outputs and error messages. Error messages are referred to as the _**error stream**._

## Executables

Unix-like operating systems provides the `/bin`directory which contains programs you may call directly from the command line.  These are called _executables_ because they are ready to be run when the system starts. 

* `/bin`
  * Standard subdirectory of the root directory in Unix-like operating systems that contains the executable \(i.e., ready to run\) programs that must be available in order to attain minimal functionality for the purposes of booting \(i.e., starting\) and repairing a system 
* `/usr/bin`
  * Standard directory on [Unix-like](http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html) [operating systems](http://www.linfo.org/operating_systems_list.html) that contains most of the [_executable files_](http://www.linfo.org/executable.html) \(i.e., ready-to-run [programs](http://www.linfo.org/program.html)\) that are not needed for booting \(i.e., starting\) or repairing the system
